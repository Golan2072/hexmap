This code is Open Source.

Version History:

v0.6 - February 17th, 2021
- Function added to read JSON files produced by my WorldGen script with Cepheus Light world data and generate a map accordingly. File loading interface not implemented yet, so this uses a placeholder file.

v0.5 - February 16th, 2021
- Now including 7-letter world names.

v0.4 - February 16th, 2021
- The starmap is now a string produced by a function, for increased versatility.

v0.3 - February 16th, 2021
- Major bug fixes. All columns work as intended.

v0.2.1 - February 16th, 2021
- Further bug fixes. Odd columns work as intended. Even columns are bugged.

v0.2 - February 16th, 2021
- More complete code with larger hexagons and numerous bug fixes. Still requires thorough debugging.

v0.1 - February 15th, 2021
- Initial code upload. Very partial code, very buggy. Uses placeholder data rather than procedurally generated/JSON/SEC data.
